# React-router-website

Simple website created in React Router

# To be fixed

1. In ProductPage the product name needs to be showed,
   as react-router recently updated to v6 I still cannot resolve it. Passing params with match etc. doesn't work. Possibly I will need to find another
   way to fix it
